    <p>Do you grow herbs? Tea leaves? Got a Hibiscus growing somewhere? We can make tea!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Leaves of choice <em>(Black, Passionflower, Chamomile, Hibiscus, Orange Peels, etc.)</em></li>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Creamer</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dry leaves either with a dehydrator or a shelf free of dust.</li>
        <li>Strip leaves from the stem. Though some stems, like mint, have a higher concentration of flavor. However, young stems are best because older stems become more fibrous and woody.</li>
        <li>Using an infuser, tea strainer, or teapot brew the tea for about 5-10 minutes. Longer than teabags, typically. I use an infuser.</li>
        <li>Add your milk, creamer, sugar. I love oat milk! That's it. Thank you.</li>
    </ol>
